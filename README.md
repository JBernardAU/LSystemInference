# L-System Inference Tool

## Overview

The **L-System Inference Tool** is a powerful and versatile tool designed to infer **Lindenmayer Systems (L-systems)** from provided input data. This project supports inferring the following types of L-systems:

- **Deterministic L-systems**
- **Stochastic L-systems**
- **Parametric L-systems**
- **Homomorphic L-systems**

Additionally, the tool is capable of handling both **context-sensitive** and **context-free** L-systems, making it a comprehensive solution for researchers and practitioners working with generative systems, formal languages, and fractal-like structures.

## Features

- **Deterministic L-systems**: Infers deterministic rewriting rules based on input.
- **Stochastic L-systems**: Learns probabilistic rewriting rules for variability in outputs.
- **Parametric L-systems**: Handles L-systems with parameters, allowing for greater flexibility and expressiveness.
- **Homomorphic L-systems**: Supports mapping from one structure to another with defined transformations.
- **Context Sensitivity**: Compatible with both context-free and context-sensitive scenarios.

## Use Cases

- Biological modeling (e.g., plant growth simulation)
- Procedural content generation in computer graphics
- Formal language theory and research
- Fractal generation and analysis
