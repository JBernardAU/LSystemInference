Description:
This library implements the L-System Inference Tool (LSIT) formerly known as the Plant Model Inference Tool (PMIT).


1. SETTINGS CONFIGURATION

1.1 Modes

There are two possible modes: Experimental and Inference. Experimental mode is used to evaluate how well LSIT can
infer a known a L-system. In Inference mode, only a sequence of words is provided and LSIT will infer the best
possible L-system. The main difference is in inference mode less assumptions are made about underlying L-system.

1.2 L-System Name

This is the name of the L-system to infer. It must match the name of the python file exactly with the ".py" extension
in the "LSystem" subdirectory. E.g, CantorDust to load the Cantor Dust L-system. Unknown L-systems may be given any
name, but again must match the .py file name to be loaded properly.

1.3 AI Type

This must be GeneticAlgorithm. Other AI methods may be supported in the future.

1.4. Context Lengths

The possible options are: Known, Size, Infer.

The "Known" setting LSIT to know the context lengths for every predecessor. This will only work in "Experimental" mode.
Using this setting in "Inference" mode will default to the "Infer" option.

The "Size" option uses the values set in the .py file. This can be used in either mode.

The "Infer" causes LSIT to attempt to infer the sizes.
